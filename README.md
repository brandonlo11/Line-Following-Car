# Line-Following-Car
Line Follower is a program written in Arduino (based on C and C++) which allows the TI-RSLK robotic car to follow a black line over a track. As per the project requirements, once the car sees a horizontal line at the end of the track, it completes a 180 degree turn then repeats the track backwards before stopping back at the beginning.

To keep the car on the line, PID controls as well as wheel encodings are used

The working code for the assignment is in FullCode.

The extra credit portion of the assignment was to complete the track in under 15 seconds. Even more extra credit was rewarded for finishing under 10 seconds.

Developed using Energia for the TI-RSLK kit (TI Launchpad).
